# V2.1.3

Finally fits together!!!

## Issues:
- Print orientation needs to be with axles pointing up? 
  Support structure makes the print came out with rough  
  surface the messes with the tolerances  
  
- Not enogh clearance around the points of rotation.  
  Degrees of moevement for joints is limited to only 45 degrees
  
## Points for next iteration:
- Address previous issues  
- Change tendon rail design  
  Requires a drill to remove, and currently points   
  to much stress in too small of a spot
