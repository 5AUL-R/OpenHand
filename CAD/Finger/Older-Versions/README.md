## Design log

### V1.0  
This design was an okay first start but it had numerous problems. 
- Too complex
- Not very suitable for 3D printing (Lots of parts that needed very tight tolerances, that can be quite impractical even with a good 3D printer) 
- The design overall was not very good for movement of the fingers, it was an awkard design
